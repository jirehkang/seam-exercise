# Getting Started with the Seam Disco Lights Dashboard

[Seam Disco Lights Dashboard](https://seam-disco-lights-dashboard.vercel.app/) is your command center for easily controlling disco lights whether you're lighting up one room or coordinating across multiple venues. This guide covers the basics: how to view your lights, adjust their settings, and apply scenes to set the mood in just a few clicks.

## View Your Available Lights

When you open the dashboard, the **Lights Control** panel on the left displays all available disco lights.

Each light shows its name, current settings, and a status indicator. A green indicator means it's online and ready to be controlled. A red indicator means it's offline and can't be modified until it reconnects.

## Adjust a Light's Brightness, Mode, and Color

To adjust settings, click the light in the list to open the **Light Control** panel, which appears on the right.

- **Brightness**: Drag the slider to set the brightness between 0 and 100.
- **Mode**: Use the dropdown menu to select **Solid**, **Strobe**, **Pulse**, or **Rainbow**.
- **Color**: You have two options, as shown in the image below.
	1.	Select a preset color.
	2.	Click the color square, then either choose a color using the picker or enter a custom RGB, HSL, or HEX value.

After making changes, click **Save Changes** to apply them.

## Apply a Scene

Scenes let you preset brightness, color, and mode for multiple lights so you don't have to adjust each one individually.

To use a scene, go to the **Scenes** panel on the right and click **Apply** next to the one you want. All connected lights will update instantly with the scene's settings.

## Make It Your Own 

Nice work, you've got the essentials down! Now let's explore how you can customize your setup to fit your space and routine.

- **Create a custom scene that fits your space**: Try warm solids for dinner services, rainbow pulses for a DJ set, or soft blues for late-night hours.
- **Match your schedule**: Set up presets for different times of day or event types. Switch between them with a single click.

Your lights are ready. Set the tone, own the vibe, and bring your space to life.
